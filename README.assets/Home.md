## Config Files

There are two config files that contain Storj network and framework connection information. The tool is designed so you can specify a config file as part of your tooling/workflow.

##### `local.json`

Inside the `./config` directory there is a `local.json` file, with following information about your framework(local file in this case) instance:

* `path`- Path to local file

##### `storj_config.json`

Inside the `./config` directory a `storj_config.json` file, with Storj network configuration information in JSON format:

* `apiKey` - API Key created in Storj Satellite GUI(mandatory)
* `satelliteURL` - Storj Satellite URL(mandatory)
* `encryptionPassphrase` - Storj Encryption Passphrase(mandatory)
* `bucketName` - Name of the bucket to upload data into(mandatory)
* `uploadPath` - Path on Storj Bucket to store data (optional) or "/" (mandatory)
* `serializedAccess` - Serialized access shared while uploading data used to access bucket without API Key (mandatory while using *accesskey* flag)
* `allowDownload` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted download (mandatory while using *share* flag)
* `allowUpload` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted upload (mandatory while using *share* flag)
* `allowList` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted list access
* `allowDelete` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted delete
* `notBefore` - Set time that is always before *notAfter*
* `notAfter` - Set time that is always after *notBefore*

## Run

Back-up is uploaded by streaming to the Storj network.

The following flags can be used with the `store` command:

* `accesskey` - Connects to the Storj network using a serialized access key instead of an API key, satellite url and encryption passphrase.
* `shared` - Generates a restricted shareable serialized access with the restrictions specified in the Storj configuration file.

Once you have built the project you can run the following:

##### Get help

```
$ ./connector-framework --help
```

##### Check version

```
$ ./connector-framework --version
```

##### Upload back-up data to Storj

```
$ ./connector-framework store --local <path_to_local_config_file> --storj <path_to_storj_config_file>
```

##### Upload back-up data to Storj bucket using Access Key

```
$ ./connector-framework store --accesskey
```

##### Upload back-up data to Storj and generate a Shareable Access Key based on restrictions in `storj_config.json`

```
$ ./connector-framework store --share
```
